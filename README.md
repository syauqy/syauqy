# Hi there, I'm Syauqy 👋

I'm currently a product manager at [Jala](https://jala.tech), a SaaS startup that helps shrimp farmers manage their farms using data. 

Currently spending free time learning React, Typescript, Mapbox, and Tensorflow.js

Some of the fun projects that I've done or are currently working on,
- 🤟 [Handsign](https://github.com/syauqy/handsign-tensorflow-gatsby) : Simple ASL (American Sign Language) alphabet detection using Tensorflow.js
- 🐶 [Corgy Porgy](https://github.com/syauqy/corgyporgy) : Web app to indentify a corgi using Tensorflow.js, inspired by Silicon Valley's "hotdog not a hotdog app".
- 😎 [Gatsby Hello World Chakra UI](https://github.com/syauqy/gatsby-hello-world-chakra) : Clean boilerplate of a Gatsby project equipped with Chakra UI components. It helps me a lot when starting a new project (that will never finish).
