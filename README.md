# Hi there, I'm Syauqy 👋

I'm currently a product manager at [Jala](https://jala.tech), a SaaS startup that helps shrimp farmers manage their farms using data.
I'm also working on a new project called [Matcharge](https://matcharge.app), Simple subscriptions and free trials tracker and reminder.

Currently spending free time building mobile apps for iOS

Some of the fun projects that I've done or am currently working on,
- 🌱 [Pippin - Overthinking Journal](https://getpippin.app): Pippin is a minimalist journaling app designed for overthinkers. It gives your thoughts a safe place to land — without pressure, judgment, or advice.
- 🍵 [Matcharge](https://matcharge.app): Matcharge helps you find financial calm by beautifully visualizing and tracking your subscriptions in a unique Zen Garden.
- 👀 [HiringFast](https://hiringfa.st): AI-powered CV and resume screener.
- 🤟 [Handsign](https://github.com/syauqy/handsign-tensorflow-gatsby): Simple ASL (American Sign Language) alphabet detection using Tensorflow.js
- 🐶 [Corgy Porgy](https://github.com/syauqy/corgyporgy): Web app to identify a corgi using Tensorflow.js, inspired by Silicon Valley's "hotdog not a hotdog app".
- 😎 [Gatsby Hello World Chakra UI](https://github.com/syauqy/gatsby-hello-world-chakra): Clean boilerplate of a Gatsby project equipped with Chakra UI components. It helps me a lot when starting a new project (that will never finish).
